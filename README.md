# Java-KBC-Game
I have made a simple kbc game using java with all features of abc. Like awarding points, giving lifelines and quitting rules.

you can run the code over you pc by downloading .class file.
to view the source code view .java file.

rules of the game:-
You have two Lifelines in this whole game.
		50-50 --> Erase half wrong options
		Double dip --> Give a extra chance to answer if you get wrong
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  For every right answer you will be awarded 10000 points
You can quit anytime in the game by clicking q over promting to quit
***But you will be awarded 0 opints as prize if you want to quit before answering two questions***
Over violating any of the rules like trying to feed option which is not available you will be out of game
